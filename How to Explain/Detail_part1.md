# **📘 SIMPLE NOTES : User Lifecycle Management 

---

# **1. What is User Lifecycle Management (ULM)?**

ULM is a system/platform that helps companies to create, manage, and control **digital identities** for their users.

Think of it Like a “brain” behind user accounts, logins, permissions, profiles, privacy, and service access — all in one place.

---

# **2. Why is Digital Identity Important Today?**

Because people now expect everything to be:

* Online
* Fast
* Available anywhere
* Without needing support calls or visiting a store

Examples: Using Netflix, ordering food, logging into banking apps, unlocking a smart home device — all require a digital identity.

Companies like **Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon** manage billions of digital identities.
ULM helps other companies offer the same kind of advanced digital identity services.

# **3. How ULM Evolved from Traditional IAM (Identity and Access Management.)**

Traditional IAM only focused on two things:

1. **Authentication** — Are you who you say you are? (login, passwords, OTP)
2. **Authorization** — What can you access?

But companies now need much more, like:

* User profiles
* Groups (family accounts, teams)
* Delegation
* Privacy controls
* Service personalization
* Easy onboarding
* Logs and audits

ULM adds all these advanced features **out-of-the-box**.
