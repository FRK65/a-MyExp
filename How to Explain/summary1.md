# ✅ **ULM SYSTEM — STRUCTURED SUMMARY (Clear & Professional)**

---

# ⭐ 1. What is ULM?

ULM (User Lifecycle Management) is a **central identity and subscription management platform** used by Vodafone (VF) Italy and Germany to manage:

* User registration
* Onboarding (user creation + verification)
* Contract / no-contract customers
* Accounts, subscriptions, and groups
* Authentication (Web, Admin, Retail users)
* User sessions and security
* Integration with VF internal systems
* Data synchronization with CRM/ACRM
* Kafka-based real-time sync
* MIGRATION (Legacy → Next Platform)

ULM acts as the **single source of truth** for Web user data.

---

# ⭐ 2. Types of Users Managed

### **1. Web User (Real VF Customer)**

* Purchases SIM, number, subscription
* Stored in ULM database
* Login:

  * 1FA → Username/Password
  * 2FA → Password + OTP
  * MFA → OTP + eventClass code
* Session timeout → 30 minutes (inactive)

### **2. Retail User (Shop / SIM Retailer)**

* Has limited admin permissions
* Not stored in ULM DB
* Login via **SAML / OIDC / Token-based login**
* Session timeout → 120 minutes

### **3. Admin User**

* Full access
* Only one admin user exists in ULM
* Can act as both admin + retail
* Login: SAML / OIDC / Partner Token
* Session timeout → 120 minutes

---

# ⭐ 3. High-Level Process Flow (Web User)

### **1. Registration**

User provides:

* MSISDN
* Fiscal Code (like PAN)

**CRM validates** → if OK → ULM allows registration.

### **2. Account Creation**

ULM creates:

* User
* Account
* Subscription
* Group (Customer group)

### **3. Token Generation**

ULM generates a session token → user can call VF services.

### **4. Data Sync**

ULM updates:

* CRM
* ACRM
* ACDC
* DXL
* Other VF systems (machine-to-machine APIs)

### **5. Kafka Events**

Every operation → ULM **publishes success/failure events**.

### **6. Session Management**

ULM centrally manages login & logout for:

* Web
* Admin
* Retail users

---

# ⭐ 4. Enriched User (Special Case)

A user who is **not registered** but wants to view:

* Campaigns
* Offers
* Basic subscription details

ULM creates a temporary user:

`username = Enriched@<contact_number>`

Later if the same user registers:

* ULM deletes enriched user
* Creates proper web user
* Creates account + subscription

---

# ⭐ 5. Data Stored in ULM (Oracle SQL)

ULM stores only **web user data**.

### Key Tables (Based on your SQL examples):

* **MT_USER2SUB** → Link between user and subscription
* **EXT_USER2SUB_ATR** → User-subscription attributes
* **EXT_SUB_ATR** → Subscription attributes (SOLSTICE_PRODUCT_ID etc.)
* **MT_GROUP2SUB** → Group-subscription mapping
* **EXT_GROUP2SUB_ATR** → Group-sub attributes
* **MT_GROUP & MT_GROUP2USER** → Group and membership
* **MT_USER2ACCOUNT & EXT_USER2ACCOUNT_ATR**
* **MT_ACCOUNT & EXT_ACCOUNT_ATR**
* **MT_SUB** → Subscription master table
* **EXT_GROUP_ATR** → Group-level attributes

ULM also uses:

* Stored procedures
* SQL scripts
* Batch deletion scripts
* Re-indexing after migration

---

# ⭐ 6. Data Flow with VF (Italy vs. Germany)

### **Nomenclature**

VF Italy → "Legacy + Next"
VF Germany → "Next Only" + strong OIDC/JWT model

---

### ✔ VF Italy — Data Flow

* ULM has real-time access to live customer data
* CRM returns validation for MSISDN & fiscal code
* ULM stores complete user data
* Kafka events consumed/produced by ULM
* Legacy → Next migration done every 2–3 months
* Uses SQL scripts, stored procedures, sh scripts
* Large batch migrations (millions of records)
* Staging tables → Main tables (chunk processing)

---

### ✔ VF Germany — Data Flow

* ULM **does not** have direct access to actual production CRM data
* VF systems expose APIs only (no DB access)
* Uses:

  * OIDC, JWT tokens
  * partner-key + partner-secret
  * X-part-auth
* User migration done in 4 stages:

  * User
  * Account
  * Subscription
  * Customer/Group

---

# ⭐ 7. Authentication & Session Management

### **Web User**

* Username/password
* OTP
* MFA event
* Token generated by ULM
* Session timeout 30 min

### **Retail/Admin User**

* SAML
* OIDC
* JWT token
* Partner key + secret
* Session timeout 120 min

ULM handles:

* Login
* Logout
* Token generation
* Token validation
* Session expiry

---

# ⭐ 8. Integrations (3rd Party)

ULM integrates with multiple VF systems:

| System      | Purpose                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| CRM         | Validate user MSISDN/fiscal code |
| ACRM        | Main customer data store for VF  |
| ANM         | Network management               |
| ACDX / ADXL | Product/subscription management  |
| DXL         | Data exchange layer              |
| Kafka       | Event sync across systems        |
| Frontend    | Web portals, Apps, Retail app    |

---

# ⭐ 9. Kafka in ULM (Important)

Kafka plays major role:

### **ULM Consumes Events**

* User registered
* Subscription activated
* Account created
* Group created

### **ULM Produces Events**

* Success events (user creation, subscription changes)
* Failure events (error details)

Events include:

* User ID
* Contact
* Email
* Subscription ID
* Operation status
* Stack trace (for failure)

Used for monitoring and reconciliation.

---

# ⭐ 10. Migration (Legacy → Next)

Migration happens **quarterly**.

### Process:

1. VF sends CSV files
2. Load CSV into staging tables
3. Clean, validate, transform
4. Insert into target ULM tables
5. Chunk/batch process for millions of records
6. Indexing & re-indexing
7. Run reconciliations
8. Test in lower environments
9. Deploy to production

Includes:

* User migration
* Account migration
* Subscription migration
* Group migration

# ⭐ 13. Clean “Short Summary” (for explaining to someone in 2 mins)

ULM is Vodafone’s identity, subscription, and user lifecycle platform. It handles registration, authentication, account creation, and subscription assignment for Vodafone Italy and Germany.

Web users authenticate with MFA; retail and admin users authenticate using SAML/OIDC tokens. ULM generates tokens used to access other VF systems.

ULM stores all Web user data in Oracle DB with complex mapping tables like user-subscription, group-subscription, and account mappings. Data is synchronized with CRM/ACRM via APIs and Kafka events. Failed or partial syncs are reprocessed via reconciliation APIs.

Italy uses both legacy and next platform; Germany uses next only with strong token-based architecture. Quarterly migrations move customers from legacy to next using SQL, shell scripts, staging tables, and indexing.

Enriched users allow non-registered users to view offers. ULM cleans or upgrades enriched users when they register. ULM also integrates with CRM, ACRM, ANM, DXL, etc. for real-time validation and provisioning.
